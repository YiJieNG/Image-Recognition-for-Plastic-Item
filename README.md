In this project, a pre-trained YOLOv9c model is utilized with transfer learning to enhance the precision of plastic item detection. By leveraging knowledge from large-scale object detection datasets, transfer learning allows the model to effectively recognize various types of plastic waste. Rather than training the model from scratch, it is fine-tuned on a specialized dataset of plastic waste images, enabling it to adapt its parameters for accurate detection and classification of different plastic items in user-submitted images.
